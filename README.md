## Overview

This application allow users to keep track of their workout by adding exercises routines objects to an array of exercices that is part of a workout object. As a boiler plate I was given the code base of the `Front-End` of this app courtesy of another fellow developer. My work here was to create a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handle routes with Express `Back-End`.

## User_Story

- As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

## Tech_Specs

`Back-End` of this app was developed with MongoDB database with a Mongoose ORM schema and handle routes with Express.
